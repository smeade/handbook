> There will likely always be parts of this handbook in draft form and in various stages of completeness and accuracy. Where parts seem week and unpolished it is possible I am an unpolished writer, that those parts are a work-in-progress or both.

> Please notice this as _a_ software developer's handbook. This handbook is not authoritative nor intended to be exhaustive. There's many ways to get the job done.

## Overview

This handbook serves as:

* **A developer's diary**. There are many [benefits](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/become-better-coder-keeping-programming-journal/) to keeping a developer's diary or journal. I have been keeping a daily developer's journal for some time. It does help get the day's work done. Yet I have not referred to past entries very often. Perhaps capturing and organizing entries in a handbook format will help me extract more value from daily experiences and lessons learned.
* **A process manual**. A software developer's work consists of many processes that are repeated daily, weekly, monthly or through each project. Formalizing my experiences into written processes helps to clarify and refine those processes.
* **A reference to demonstration apps**. A wonderful thing about Heroku is the ability to deploy apps for free. I would love to have some demonstration apps deployed for reference and discussion.
* **A scratchpad for ideas**.
